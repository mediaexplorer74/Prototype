Some people may have issues with the game not starting up.
This could be because of the use of pbuffers, before discarding please try
disabling them in the engine.cfg using PBuffers	= 0

All my games run best with vsync enabled, I leave this open to you, I will not touch your
refresh rate. You can however, disable vsync in the cfg if you desire.

There are some other little things you may also tweak there if you wish.
I'm defaulting to Windowed mode, but you can use Fullscreen. See engine.cfg
I have targeted a GF3 as minimum, but who knows maybe it will work on older machines, I would
appreciate some feedback on that. At a minimum I would recommend a 32mb Gfx card with opengl
support.

You may use a joystick- its not required, but will surely help improve the game quality.

Ok so many people have complained its too difficult, so I've added shields to the easy and medium
settings, this will only defend you against scrapes with weak bullets and enemies.
